        <p>ALICE was   beginning   to   get   very   tired   ofsitting  by  her  sister  on  the  bank,  and  of  havingnothing  to  do :  once  or  twice  she  had  peeped  intothe  book  her  sister  was  reading,  but  it  had  nopictures  or  conversations  in  it,  “and  what  isthe  use  of  a  book,”  thought  Alice,  “withoutpictures  or  conversations ?”</p>
        <p>So   she   was   considering   in   her   own   mind,(as  well  as  she  could,  for  the  hot  day  madeher  feel  very  sleepy  and  stupid,)  whether  thepleasure   of   making   a   daisy-chain   would   beworth   the   trouble   of   getting   up   and   pickingthe  daisies,  when  suddenly  a  white  rabbit  withpink  eyes  ran  close  by  her.</p>
        <p>There   was   nothing   so   very remarkable   inthat ;  nor  did  Alice  think  it  so  very much  outof  the  way  to  hear  the  Rabbit  say  to  itself,“Oh   dear !   Oh   dear !   I   shall   be   too   late !”(when   she   thought   it   over   afterwards,   it   oc-curred  to  her  that  she  ought  to  have  wonderedat   this,   but   at   the   time   it   all   seemed   quitenatural) ;  but  when  the  Rabbit  actually  took  awatch  out  of  its  waistcoat-pocket,and  looked  atit,  and  then  hurried  on,  Alice  started  to  herfeet,  for  it  flashed  across  her  mind  that  she  hadnever  before  seen  a  rabbit  with  either  a  waist-coat-pocket  or  a  watch  to  take  out  of  it,  and,burning  with  curiosity,  she  ran  across  the  fieldafter  it,  and  was  just  in  time  to  see  it  popdown  a  large  rabbit-hole  under  the  hedge.</p>
        <p>In  another  moment  down  went  Alice  afterit,   never   once   considering   how   in   the   worldshe  was  to  get  out  again.</p>
